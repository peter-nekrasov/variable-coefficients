Peter's code for solving variable coefficient scattering problems in 2D. The exact form of these scattering problems are below. This code uses the fact that the Lippman-Schwinger equation for each problem looks like an identity plus the sum of translationally invariant operators:

$$ \alpha_0(x) \mu(x) + \sum_{i=1}^N V_i(x) \int_{\Omega} K_i (x-y) \mu(y)  d y $$ 

where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.
